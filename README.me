# Simple Blockchain Implementation in Python

This project is a basic implementation of a blockchain and a cryptocurrency using Python and Flask. It includes functionalities to mine new blocks, create new transactions, and query the full blockchain. This implementation is inspired by the article [Learn Blockchains by Building One](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46).

## Features

- **Blockchain**: Create a blockchain with blocks and transactions.
- **Mining**: Implement proof-of-work to mine new blocks.
- **Transactions**: Create and add new transactions to the blockchain.
- **API**: Interact with the blockchain through a simple Flask-based API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain.git
    cd blockchain
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

### API Endpoints

- **Mine a new block**
    ```bash
    GET /mine
    ```

- **Create a new transaction**
    ```bash
    POST /transactions/new
    ```
    - Body (JSON):
        ```json
        {
            "sender": "c04f4a2c3ded478f94eadb12468585c2",
            "recipient": "someone-other-address",
            "amount": 5
        }
        ```

- **Get the full blockchain**
    ```bash
    GET /chain
    ```

## Example Usage

### Mine a new block

```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/mine
```

### Create a new transaction

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "sender": "c04f4a2c3ded478f94eadb12468585c2",
    "recipient": "someone-other-address",
    "amount": 5
}' http://127.0.0.1:5001/transactions/new
```

### Get the full blockchain

```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/chain
```

## Code Overview

### Blockchain Class

- **new_block**: Creates a new block and adds it to the chain.
- **new_transaction**: Adds a new transaction to the list of transactions.
- **hash**: Creates a SHA-256 hash of a block.
- **last_block**: Returns the last block in the chain.
- **proof_of_work**: Simple proof of work algorithm to find the next proof.
- **valid_proof**: Validates the proof by checking if it contains 4 leading zeroes.

### Flask Routes

- **/mine**: Mines a new block.
- **/transactions/new**: Creates a new transaction.
- **/chain**: Returns the full blockchain.
